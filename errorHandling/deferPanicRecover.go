// NOTE:
// go's ideology is that adding exceptions like try/catch/finally would
// result in complex code and encourage programmers to label too many basic
// error, like failiing to open a file as exceptional.

// you should not use defer/panic/recover as try/catch/finally.
// rather use it FIXME: very judiciously.

// NOTE:
// DEFER is using for cleaning up resources.
// 1. Defer is a lang mechanism that puts your function into callstack.
// 2. Each defer is executed in reverse order when the host function finihes.

// NOTE: PANIC
// panic is a builtin function that stops the normal flow execution.
// Use it in rare scenarios when nothing can be done.
// NOTE: the flow is first all the defers will be executed then panic will be called

/**
Panics are something I very rarely use within my day-to-day
Go application development. Most of the time,
catching an error from whatever Iâ€™m calling and
then logging it out and possibly emitting a metric that lets me know how often this is
happening is the preferential option.
